# jmallas1-U1-GlobalApp
Create a program that reads the files: places.csv and stuff.csv.  The places file is the driver and the stuff file is the transaction file.  There are numerous ways to solve the following problem.

The program must include JavaDoc, Junit and be uploaded to GitHub.  Name this project: XXXXX-U1-GlobalApp, where “XXXXX” is your WCTC userid.  (Ex: Matt Green with an email of mgreen14@wctc.edu would name his project mgreen14-U1-GlobalApp.

Create a report that prints out each country and the number of cities listed in the places file and the number of stuff listed in the stuff file. For some countries,  the same "stuff" appears more than once for the same country. For example, Argentina has two entries for twister. Count those instances as 1 "stuff" item for that country. That is, count the unique instances of "stuff" as if it was a catalog, not as if it was a warehouse inventory.
